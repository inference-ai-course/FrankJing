Abstract
This paper explores the automatic construction
of a multilingual Lexical Knowledge Base from
pre-existing lexical resources. We present a new
and robust approach for linking already existing
lexical/semantic hierarchies.
We used a con-
straint satisfaction algorithm (relaxation label-
ing) to select –among all the candidate trans-
lations proposed by a bilingual dictionary– the
right English WordNet synset for each sense in
a taxonomy automatically derived from a Span-
ish monolingual dictionary. Although on aver-
age, there are 15 possible WordNet connections
for each sense in the taxonomy, the method
achieves an accuracy over 80%. Finally, we also
propose several ways in which this technique
could be applied to enrich and improve exist-
ing lexical databases.

Introduction
There is an increasing need of having available
general, accurate and broad coverage multilin-
gual lexical/semantic resources for developing
nl applications.
Thus, a very active ﬁeld in-
side nl during the last years has been the fast
development of generic language resources.
Several attempts have been performed to pro-
duce multilingual ontologies. In (Ageno et al.,
1994), a Spanish/English bilingual dictionary is
used to (semi)automatically link Spanish and
English taxonomies extracted from dgile (Al-
var, 1987) and ldoce (Procter, 1987).
Sim-
ilarly, a simple automatic approach for link-
ing Spanish taxonomies extracted from dgile
to WordNet (Miller et al., 1991) synsets is
proposed in (Rigau et al., 1995).
The work
reported in (Knight and Luk, 1994) focuses
on the construction of Sensus, a large knowl-
edge base for supporting the Pangloss machine
translation system.
In (Okumura and Hovy,
1994) (semi)automatic methods for associating
a Japanese lexicon to an English ontology us-
ing a bilingual dictionary are described. Sev-
eral experiments aligning edr and WordNet on-
tologies are described in (Utiyama and Hasida,
1997). Several lexical resources and techniques
are combined in (Atserias et al., 1997) to map
Spanish words from a bilingual dictionary to
WordNet, and in (Farreres et al., 1998) the
use of the taxonomic structure derived from a
monolingual mrd is proposed as an aid to this
mapping process.
This paper presents a novel approach for
merging already existing hierarchies.
The
method has been applied to attach substan-
tial fragments of the Spanish taxonomy derived
from dgile (Rigau et al., 1998) to the English
WordNet using a bilingual dictionary for con-
necting both hierarchies.
This paper is organized as follows: In section
2 we describe the used technique (the relaxation
labeling algorithm) and its application to hier-
archy mapping.
In section 3 we describe the
constraints used in the relaxation process, and
ﬁnally, after presenting some experiments and
preliminary results, we oﬀer some conclusions
and outline further lines of research.

Application of Relaxation
Labeling to NLP
Relaxation labeling (RL) is a generic name for
a family of iterative algorithms which perform
function optimization, based on local informa-
tion.
See (Torras, 1989) for a summary.
Its
most remarkable feature is that it can deal with
any kind of constraints, thus, the model can be
improved by adding any constraints available,
and the algorithm is independent of the com-
plexity of the model. That is, we can use more
sophisticated constraints without changing the

algorithm.
The algorithm has been applied to pos tag-
ging (M`arquez and Padr´o, 1997), shallow pars-
ing (Voutilainen and Padr´o, 1997) and to word
sense disambiguation (Padr´o, 1998).
Although other function optimization algo-
rithms could have been used (e.g. genetic algo-
rithms, simmulated annealing, etc.), we found
RL to be suitable to our purposes, given its abil-
ity to use models based on context constraints,
and the existence of previous work on applying
it to nlp tasks.
Detailed explanation of the algorithm can be
found in (Torras, 1989), while its application
to NLP tasks, advantages and drawbacks are
addressed in (Padr´o, 1998).
2.1
Algorithm Description
The Relaxation Labeling algorithm deals with
a set of variables (which may represent words,
synsets, etc.), each of which may take one
among several diﬀerent labels (pos tags, senses,
mrd entries, etc.). There is also a set of con-
straints which state compatibility or incompat-
ibility of a combination of pairs variable–label.
The aim of the algorithm is to ﬁnd a weight
assignment for each possible label for each vari-
able, such that (a) the weights for the labels of
the same variable add up to one, and (b) the
weight assignation satisﬁes –to the maximum
possible extent– the set of constraints.
Summarizing, the algorithm performs con-
straint satisfaction to solve a consistent labeling
problem. The followed steps are:
1. Start with a random weight assignment.
2. Compute the support value for each label
of each variable. Support is computed ac-
cording to the constraint set and to the cur-
rent weights for labels belonging to context
variables.
3. Increase the weights of the labels more
compatible with the context (larger sup-
port) and decrease those of the less com-
patible labels (smaller support). Weights
are changed proportionally to the support
received from the context.
4. If a stopping/convergence criterion is sat-
isﬁed, stop, otherwise go to step 2.
We
use the criterion of stopping when there are
no more changes, although more sophisti-
cated heuristic procedures may also be used
to stop relaxation processes (Eklundh and
Rosenfeld, 1978; Richards et al., 1981).
The cost of the algorithm is proportional to
the product of the number of variables by the
number of constraints.
2.2
Application to taxonomy mapping
As described in previous sections, the problem
we are dealing with is to map two taxonomies.
That is:
• The
starting
point
is
a
sense
disam-
biguated Spanish taxonomy –automatically
extracted from a monolingual dictionary
(Rigau et al., 1998)–.
• We have a conceptual taxonomy (e.g.
WordNet (Miller et al., 1991)), in which
the nodes represent concepts, organized as
synsets.
• We want to relate both taxonomies in order
to have an assignation of each sense of the
Spanish taxonomy to a WN synset.
The modeling of the problem is the following:
• Each sense in the Spanish taxonomy is a
variable for the relaxation algorithm.
• The possible labels for that variable, are
all the WN synsets which contain a word
that is a possible translation of the Span-
ish sense. Thus, we will need a bilingual
dictionary to know all the possible trans-
lations for a given Spanish word. This has
the eﬀect of losing the sense information we
had in the Spanish taxonomy.
• The algorithm will need constraints stating
whether a synset is a suitable assignment
for a sense. These constraints will rely on
the taxonomy structure. Details are given
in section 3.
3
The Constraints
Constraints are used by relaxation labeling al-
gorithm to increase or decrease the weight for a
variable label. In our case, constraints increase
the weights for the connections between a sense
in the Spanish taxonomy and a WordNet synset.
Increasing the weight for a connection implies

decreasing the weights for all the other possi-
ble connections for the same node. To increase
the weight for a connection, constraints look for
already connected nodes that have the same re-
lationships in both taxonomies.
Although there is a wide range of relation-
ships between WordNet synsets which can be
used to build constraints, we have focused on
the hyper/hyponym relationships. That is, we
increase the weight for a connection when the
involved nodes have hypernyms/hyponyms also
connected. We consider hyper/hyponym rela-
tionships either directly or indirectly (i.e. an-
cestors or descendants), depending on the kind
of constraint used.
Figure 1 shows an example of possible con-
nections between two taxonomies. Connection
C4 will have its weight increased due to C5, C6
and C1, while connections C2 and C3 will have
their weights decreased.

Figure 1:
Example of connections between tax-
onomies.
Constraints are coded with three characters
xyz, which are read as follows: The last char-
acter, z, indicates whether the constraints re-
quires the existence of a connected hypernym
(e), hyponym (o), or both (b). The two ﬁrst
characters indicate how the hyper/hyponym re-
lationship is considered in the Spanish taxon-
omy (character x) and in WordNet (charac-
ter y): (i) indicates that only immediate hy-
per/hyponym match, and (a) indicates that any
ancestor/descendant matches.
Thus, we have constraints iie/iio which in-
crease the weight for a connection between a
Spanish sense and a WordNet synset when there
is a connection between their respective hyper-
nyms/hyponyms. Constraint iib requires the si-
multaneous satisfaction of iie and iio.
Similarly, we have constraints iae/iao, which
increase the weight for a connection between a
Spanish sense and a WordNet synset when there
is a connection between the immediate hyper-
nym/hyponym of the Spanish sense and any an-
cestor/descendant of the wn synset. Constraint
iab requires the simultaneous satisfaction of iae
and iao. Symmetrically, constraints aie, aio
and aib, admit recursion on the Spanish taxon-
omy, but not in WordNet.
Finally, constraints aae, aao and aab, admit
recursion on both sides.
For instance, the following example shows a
taxonomy in which the iie constraint would
be enough to connect the Spanish node ra-
paz to the <bird of prey> synset, given that
there is a connection between ave (hypernym
of rapaz) and animal <bird> (hypernym of
<bird of prey>).
animal =⇒(Tops <animal,animate being,...>)
=⇒(person <beast,brute,...>)
=⇒(person <dunce,blockhead,...>)
ave =⇒(animal <bird>)
=⇒(animal <fowl,poultry,...>)
=⇒(artifact <bird,shuttle,...>)
=⇒(food <fowl,poultry,...>)
=⇒(person <dame,doll,...>)
faisan =⇒(animal <pheasant>)
=⇒(food <pheasant>)
rapaz =⇒(animal <bird of prey,...>)
=⇒(person <cub,lad,...>)
=⇒(person <chap,fellow,...>)
=⇒(person <lass,young girl,...>)
Constraint iie would –wrongly– connect the
Spanish sense fais´an to the food <pheasant>
synset, since there is a connection between its
immediate hypernym (ave) and the immedi-
ate hypernym food <pheasant> (which is food
<fowl,poultry,...>), but the animal synsets for
ave are non–immediate ancestors of the animal
synsets for <pheasant>. This would be rightly
solved when using iae or aae constraints.
More information on constraints and their ap-
plication can be found in (Daud´e et al., 1999).

Experiments and Results
In this section we will describe a set of experi-
ments and the results obtained. A brief descrip-
tion of the used resources is included to set the
reader in the test environment.

4.1
Spanish Taxonomies
We tested the relaxation labeling algorithm
with the described constraints on a set of
disambiguated Spanish taxonomies automat-
ically acquired from monolingual dictionar-
ies. These taxonomies were automatically as-
signed to a WordNet semantic ﬁle (Rigau et
al., 1997;
Rigau et al., 1998).
We tested
the performance of the method on two dif-
ferent kinds of taxonomies:
those assigned
to a well deﬁned and concrete semantic ﬁles
(noun.animal, noun.food), and those assigned
to more abstract and less structured ones
(noun.cognition and noun.communication).
We performed experiments directly on the
taxonomies extracted by (Rigau et al., 1997),
as well as on slight variations of them. Namely,
we tested on the following modiﬁed taxonomies:
+top Add a new virtual top as an hypernym
of all the top nodes of taxonomies belong-
ing to the same semantic ﬁle. The virtual
top is connected to the top synset of the
WordNet semantic ﬁle. In this way, all the
taxonomies assigned to a semantic ﬁle, are
converted to a single one.
no-senses The original taxonomies were built
taking
into
account
dictionary
entries.
Thus, the nodes are not words, but dictio-
nary senses. This test consists of collaps-
ing together all the sibling nodes that have
the same word, regardless of the dictionary
sense they came from. This is done as an
attempt to minimize the noise introduced
at the sense level by the taxonomy building
procedure.
4.2
Bilingual dictionaries
The possible connections between a node in the
Spanish taxonomy and WN synsets were ex-
tracted from bilingual dictionaries. Each node
has as candidate connections all the synsets for
all the words that are possible translations for
the Spanish word, according to the bilingual
dictionary.
Although the Spanish taxonomy
nodes are dictionary senses, bilingual dictionar-
ies translate words. Thus, this step introduces
noise in the form of irrelevant connections, since
not all translations necessarily hold for a single
dictionary sense.
We used an integration of several bilingual
sources available. This multi–source dictionary
contains 124,949 translations (between 53,830
English and 41,273 Spanish nouns).
Since not all words in the taxonomy appear in
our bilingual dictionaries, coverage will be par-
tial. Table 1 shows the percentage of nodes in
each taxonomy that appear in the dictionaries
(and thus, that may be connected to WN).
Among the words that appear in the bilingual
dictionary, some have only one candidate con-
nection –i.e. are monosemous–. Since selecting
a connection for these cases is trivial, we will fo-
cus on the polysemic nodes. Table 2 shows the
percentage of polysemic nodes (over the num-
ber of words with bilingual connection) in each
test taxonomy.
The average polysemy ratio
(number of candidate connections per Spanish
sense) is 15.8, ranging from 9.7 for taxonomies
in noun.animal, to 20.1 for less structured do-
mains such as noun.communication.
4.3
Results
In the performed tests we used simultaneously
all constraints with the same recursion pattern.
This yields the packs: ii*, ai*, ia* and aa*,
which were applied to all the taxonomies for the
four test semantic ﬁles.
Table 3 presents coverage ﬁgures for the dif-
ferent test sets, computed as the amount of
nodes for which some constraint is applied and
thus their weight assignment is changed. Per-
centage is given over the total amount of nodes
with bilingual connections.
To evaluate the precision of the algorithm, we
hand checked the results for the original tax-
onomies, using aa* constraints. Precision re-
sults can be divided in several cases, depending
on the correctness of the Spanish taxonomies
used as a starting point.
TOK, FOK The Spanish taxonomy was well
built and correctly assigned to the semantic
ﬁle.
TOK, FNOK The Spanish taxonomy was well
built, but wrongly assigned to the semantic
ﬁle.
TNOK The Spanish taxonomy was wrongly
built.
In each case, the algorithm selects a connec-
tion for each sense, we will count how many
connections are right/wrong in the ﬁrst and sec-
ond cases. In the third case the taxonomy was

wrongly extracted and is nonsense, so the assig-
nations cannot be evaluated.
Note that we can distinguish right/wrong
assignations in the second case because the con-
nections are taken into account over the whole
WN, not only on the semantic ﬁle being pro-
cessed. So, the algorithm may end up correctly
assigning the words of a hierarchy, even when
it was assigned to the wrong semantic ﬁle. For
instance, in the hierarchy
piel (skin, fur, peel, pelt)
=⇒marta (sable, marten, coal back)
=⇒vison (mink, mink coat)
all words may belong either to the semantic ﬁle
noun.substance (senses related to fur, pelt) or
to noun.animal (animal, animal part senses),
among others.
The right noun.substance
synsets for each word are selected, since there
was no synset for piel that was ancestor of the
animal senses of marta and vis´on.
In this case, the hierarchy was well built, and
well solved by the algorithm. The only mistake
was having assigned it to the noun.animal se-
mantic ﬁle, so we will count it as a right choice
of the relaxation labeling algorithm, but write
it in a separate column.
Tables 4 and 5 show the precision rates for
each original taxonomy.
In the former, ﬁg-
ures are given over polysemic words (nodes with
more than one candidate connection).
In the
later, ﬁgures are computed overall (nodes with
at least one candidate connection).
Accuracy is computed at the semantic ﬁle
level, i.e., if a word is assigned a synset of the
right semantic ﬁle, it is computed as right, oth-
erwise, as wrong.
To give an idea of the task complexity and the
quality of the reported results, even with this
simpliﬁed evaluation, consider the following:
• Those nodes with only one possible synset
for the right semantic ﬁle (30% in average,
ranging from 22% in noun.communication
to 45% in noun.animal) are not aﬀected
by the evaluation at the semantic ﬁle level.
• The remaining nodes have more than
one
possible
synset
in
the
right
se-
mantic
ﬁle:
6.3
in
average
(ranging
from
3.0
for
noun.animal to
8.7
for
noun.communication).
• Thus, we can consider that we are eval-
uating a task easier than the actual one
(the actual evaluation would be performed
at the synset level).
This simpliﬁed task
has an average polysemy of 6.7 possible
choices per sense, while the actual task at
the synset level would have 15.8. Although
this situates the baseline of a random as-
signment about 15% instead of 6%, it is
still a hard task.

Conclusions
We have applied the relaxation labeling algo-
rithm to assign an appropriate WN synset to
each node of an automatically extracted tax-
onomy. Results for two diﬀerent kinds of con-
ceptual structures have been reported, and they
point that this may be an accurate and robust
method (not based on ad-hoc heuristics) to con-
nect hierarchies (even in diﬀerent languages).

Table 4: Precision results over polysemic words for the test taxonomies.
The experiments performed up to now seem
to indicate that:
• The relaxation labeling algorithm is a good
technique to link two diﬀerent hierarchies.
For each node with several possible connec-
tions, the candidate that best matches the
surrounding structure is selected.
• The only information used by the algorithm
are the hyper/hyponymy relationships in
both taxonomies. These local constraints
are propagated throughout the hierarchies
to produce a global solution.
• There is a certain amount of noise in the
diﬀerent phases of the process. First, the
taxonomies were automatically acquired
and assigned to semantic ﬁles. Second, the
bilingual dictionary translates words, not
senses, which introduces irrelevant candi-
date connections.
• The size and coverage of the bilingual dic-
tionaries used to establish the candidate
connections is an important issue. A dic-
tionary with larger coverage increases the
amount of nodes with candidate connec-
tions and thus the algorithm coverage
6
Proposals for Further Work
Some issues to be addressed to improve the al-
gorithm performance are the following:
• Further test and evaluate the precision of
the algorithm.
In this direction we plan
–apart from performing wider hand check-
ing of the results, both to ﬁle and synset
level– to use the presented technique to link
WN1.5 with WN1.6. Since there is already
a mapping between both versions, the ex-
periment would provide an idea of the ac-
curacy of the technique and of its applica-
bility to diﬀerent hierarchies of the same
language. In addition, it would constitute
an easy way to update existing lexical re-
sources.
• Use other relationships apart from hy-
per/hyponymy to build constraints to se-
lect the best connection (e.g.
sibling,
cousin, synonymy, meronymy, etc.).
• To palliate the low coverage of the bilingual
dictionaries, candidate translations could
be inferred from connections of surround-
ing senses. For instance, if a sense has no
candidate connections, but its hypernym

does, we could consider as candidate con-
nections for that node all the hyponyms of
the synset connected to its hypernym.
• Use the algorithm to enrich the Spanish
part of EuroWordNet taxonomy. It could
also be applied to include taxonomies for
other languages not currently in the ewn
project.
In addition, some ideas to further exploit the
possibilities of these techniques are:
• Use ewn instead of wn as the target tax-
onomy.
This would largely increase the
coverage, since the candidate connections
missing in the bilingual dictionaries could
be obtained from the Spanish part of ewn,
and viceversa. In addition, it would be use-
ful to detect gaps in the Spanish part of
ewn, since a ewn synset with no Spanish
words in ewn, could be assigned one via
the connections obtained from the bilingual
dictionaries.
• Since we are connecting dictionary senses
(the entries in the mrd used to build the
taxonomies) to ewn synsets: First of all,
we could use this to disambiguate the right
sense for the genus of an entry.
For in-
stance, in the Spanish taxonomies, the
genus for the entry queso 1 (cheese) is masa
(mass) but this word has several dictio-
nary entries.
Connecting the taxonomy
to ewn, we would be able to ﬁnd out
which is the appropriate sense for masa,
and thus, which is the right genus sense for
queso 1. Secondly, once we had each dic-
tionary sense connected to a ewn synset,
we could enrich ewn with the deﬁnitions
in the mrd, using them as Spanish glosses.
• Map the Spanish part of ewn to wn1.6.
This could be done either directly, or via
mapping wn1.5–wn1.6.
