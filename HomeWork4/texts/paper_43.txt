Abstract
This paper proposes a Japanese/English cross-
language information retrieval (CLIR) system
targeting technical documents.
Our system
ﬁrst translates a given query containing tech-
nical terms into the target language, and then
retrieves documents relevant to the translated
query. The translation of technical terms is still
problematic in that technical terms are often
compound words, and thus new terms can be
progressively created simply by combining ex-
isting base words.
In addition, Japanese of-
ten represents loanwords based on its phono-
gram. Consequently, existing dictionaries ﬁnd
it diﬃcult to achieve suﬃcient coverage.
To
counter the ﬁrst problem, we use a compound
word translation method, which uses a bilin-
gual dictionary for base words and collocational
statistics to resolve translation ambiguity. For
the second problem, we propose a translitera-
tion method, which identiﬁes phonetic equiva-
lents in the target language. We also show the
eﬀectiveness of our system using a test collec-
tion for CLIR.

Introduction
Cross-language information retrieval (CLIR),
where the user presents queries in one language
to retrieve documents in another language, has
recently been one of the major topics within the
information retrieval community.
One strong
motivation for CLIR is the growing number of
documents in various languages accessible via
the Internet. Since queries and documents are
in diﬀerent languages, CLIR requires a trans-
lation phase along with the usual monolingual
retrieval phase. For this purpose, existing CLIR
systems adopt various techniques explored in
natural language processing (NLP) research. In
brief, bilingual dictionaries, corpora, thesauri
and machine translation (MT) systems are used
to translate queries or/and documents.
In this paper, we propose a Japanese/English
CLIR system for technical documents, focus-
ing on translation of technical terms.
Our
purpose also includes integration of diﬀerent
components within one framework.
Our re-
search is partly motivated by the “NACSIS”
test collection for IR systems (Kando et al.,
1998)1,
which consists of Japanese queries
and Japanese/English abstracts extracted from
technical papers (we will elaborate on the NAC-
SIS collection in Section 4).
Using this col-
lection, we investigate the eﬀectiveness of each
component as well as the overall performance of
the system.
As with MT systems, existing CLIR systems
still ﬁnd it diﬃcult to translate technical terms
and proper nouns, which are often unlisted in
general dictionaries. Since most CLIR systems
target newspaper articles, which are comprised
mainly of general words, the problem related to
unlisted words has been less explored than other
CLIR subtopics (such as resolution of transla-
tion ambiguity). However, Pirkola (1998), for
example, used a subset of the TREC collection
related to health topics, and showed that com-
bination of general and domain speciﬁc (i.e.,
medical) dictionaries improves the CLIR perfor-
mance obtained with only a general dictionary.
This result shows the potential contribution of
technical term translation to CLIR. At the same
time, note that even domain speciﬁc dictionaries
1http://www.rd.nacsis.ac.jp/~ntcadm/index-en.html

do not exhaustively list possible technical terms.
We classify problems associated with technical
term translation as given below:
(1) technical terms are often compound word,
which can be progressively created simply
by combining multiple existing morphemes
(“base words”), and therefore it is not en-
tirely satisfactory to exhaustively enumer-
ate newly emerging terms in dictionaries,
(2) Asian languages often represent loanwords
based on their special phonograms (primar-
ily for technical terms and proper nouns),
which creates new base words progressively
(in the case of Japanese, the phonogram is
called katakana).
To counter problem (1), we use the compound
word translation method we proposed (Fujii
and Ishikawa, 1999), which selects appropri-
ate translations based on the probability of oc-
currence of each combination of base words in
the target language. For problem (2), we use
“transliteration” (Chen et al., 1998; Knight
and Graehl, 1998; Wan and Verspoor, 1998).
Chen et al. (1998) and Wan and Verspoor (1998)
proposed English-Chinese transliteration meth-
ods relying on the property of the Chinese
phonetic system, which cannot be directly ap-
plied to transliteration between English and
Japanese. Knight and Graehl (1998) proposed a
Japanese-English transliteration method based
on the mapping probability between English
and Japanese katakana sounds. However, since
their method needs large-scale phoneme inven-
tories, we propose a simpler approach using
surface mapping between English and katakana
characters, rather than sounds.
Section 2 overviews our CLIR system, and
Section 3 elaborates on the translation mod-
ule focusing on compound word translation and
transliteration.
Section 4 then evaluates the
eﬀectiveness of our CLIR system by way of
the standardized IR evaluation method used in
TREC programs.

System Overview
Before explaining our CLIR system, we clas-
sify existing CLIR into three approaches in
terms of the implementation of the translation
phase.
The ﬁrst approach translates queries
into the document language (Ballesteros and
Croft, 1998; Carbonell et al., 1997; Davis and
Ogden, 1997; Fujii and Ishikawa, 1999; Hull and
Grefenstette, 1996; Kando and Aizawa, 1998;
Okumura et al., 1998), while the second ap-
proach translates documents into the query lan-
guage (Gachot et al., 1996; Oard and Hack-
ett, 1997). The third approach transfers both
queries and documents into an interlingual rep-
resentation: bilingual thesaurus classes (Mon-
gar, 1969; Salton, 1970; Sheridan and Ballerini,
1996) and language-independent vector space
models (Carbonell et al., 1997; Dumais et al.,
1996). We prefer the ﬁrst approach, the “query
translation”, to other approaches because (a)
translating all the documents in a given col-
lection is expensive, (b) the use of thesauri re-
quires manual construction or bilingual compa-
rable corpora, (c) interlingual vector space mod-
els also need comparable corpora, and (d) query
translation can easily be combined with existing
IR engines and thus the implementation cost is
low. At the same time, we concede that other
CLIR approaches are worth further exploration.
Figure 1 depicts the overall design of our
CLIR system, where most components are the
same as those for monolingual IR, excluding
“translator”.
First, “tokenizer” processes “documents” in
a given collection to produce an inverted ﬁle
(“surrogates”).
Since our system is bidirec-
tional, tokenization diﬀers depending on the
target language. In the case where documents
are in English, tokenization involves eliminat-
ing stopwords and identifying root forms for
inﬂected words, for which we used “Word-
Net” (Miller et al., 1993). On the other hand,
we segment Japanese documents into lexical
units using the “ChaSen” morphological ana-
lyzer (Matsumoto et al., 1997) and discard stop-
words. In the current implementation, we use
word-based uni-gram indexing for both English
and Japanese documents. In other words, com-
pound words are decomposed into base words
in the surrogates. Note that indexing and re-
trieval methods are theoretically independent of

the translation method.
Thereafter, the “translator” processes a query
in the source language (“S-query”) to output
the translation (“T-query”). T-query can con-
sist of more than one translation, because mul-
tiple translations are often appropriate for a sin-
gle technical term.
Finally, the “IR engine” computes the sim-
ilarity between T-query and each document
in the surrogates based on the vector space
model (Salton and McGill, 1983), and sorts doc-
ument according to the similarity, in descending
order. We compute term weight based on the
notion of TF·IDF. Note that T-query is decom-
posed into base words, as performed in the doc-
ument preprocessing.
In Section 3, we will explain the “translator”
in Figure 1, which involves compound word
translation and transliteration modules.

Overview
Given a query in the source language, tokeniza-
tion is ﬁrst performed as for target documents
(see Figure 1). To put it more precisely, we use
WordNet and ChaSen for English and Japanese
queries, respectively.
We then discard stop-
words and extract only content words.
Here,
“content words” refer to both single and com-
pound words. Let us take the following query
as an example:
improvement of data mining methods.
For this query, we discard “of”, to extract “im-
provement” and “data mining methods”.
Thereafter, we translate each extracted con-
tent word individually. Note that we currently
do not consider relation (e.g. syntactic relation
and collocational information) between content
words. If a single word, such as “improvement”
in the example above, is listed in our bilingual
dictionary (we will explain the way to produce
the dictionary in Section 3.2), we use all pos-
sible translation candidates as query terms for
the subsequent retrieval phase.
Otherwise, compound word translation is
performed.
In the case of Japanese-English
translation, we consider all possible segmenta-
tions of the input word, by consulting the dic-
tionary.
Then, we select such segmentations
that consist of the minimal number of base
words.
During the segmentation process, the
dictionary derives all possible translations for
base words. At the same time, transliteration
is performed whenever katakana sequences un-
listed in the dictionary are found. On the other
hand, in the case of English-Japanese transla-
tion, transliteration is applied to any unlisted
base word (including the case where the input
English word consists of a single base word). Fi-
nally, we compute the probability of occurrence
of each combination of base words in the target
language, and select those with greater proba-
bilities, for both Japanese-English and English-
Japanese translations.
3.2
Compound Word Translation
This section brieﬂy explains the compound
word translation method we previously pro-
posed (Fujii and Ishikawa, 1999). This method
translates input compound words on a word-by-
word basis, maintaining the word order in the
source language2. The formula for the source
compound word and one translation candidate
are represented as below.
S
=
s1, s2, . . . , sn
T
=
t1, t2, . . . , tn
2A preliminary study showed that approximately 95%
of compound technical terms deﬁned in a bilingual dic-
tionary maintain the same word order in both source and
target languages.

Here, si and ti denote i-th base words in source
and target languages, respectively.
Our task,
i.e., to select T which maximizes P(T|S), is
transformed into Equation (1) through use of
the Bayesian theorem.

T
P(T|S) = arg max
T
P(S|T) · P(T) (1)
P(S|T) and P(T) are approximated as in Equa-
tion (2), which has commonly been used in
the recent statistical NLP research (Church and
Mercer, 1993).

We produced our own dictionary, because
conventional dictionaries are comprised primar-
ily of general words and verbose deﬁnitions
aimed at human readers. We extracted 59,533
English/Japanese translations consisting of two
base words from the EDR technical terminol-
ogy dictionary, which contains about 120,000
translations related to the information process-
ing ﬁeld (Japan Electronic Dictionary Research
Institute, 1995), and segment Japanese entries
into two parts3. For this purpose, simple heuris-
tic rules based mainly on Japanese character
types (i.e., kanji, katakana, hiragana, alpha-
bets and other characters like numerals) were
used. Given the set of compound words where
Japanese entries are segmented, we correspond
English-Japanese base words on a word-by-word
basis, maintaining the word order between En-
glish and Japanese, to produce a Japanese-
English/English-Japanese base word dictionary.
As a result, we extracted 24,439 Japanese base
words and 7,910 English base words from the
EDR dictionary. During the dictionary produc-
tion, we also count the collocational frequency
for each combination of si and ti, in order to
estimate P(si|ti). Note that in the case where
3The number of base words can easily be identiﬁed
based on English words, while Japanese compound words
lack lexical segmentation.
si is transliterated into ti, we use an arbitrar-
ily predeﬁned value for P(si|ti). For the esti-
mation of P(ti+1|ti), we use the word-based bi-
gram statistics obtained from target language
corpora, i.e., “documents” in the collection (see
Figure 1).
3.3
Transliteration
Figure 2 shows example correspondences be-
tween English and (romanized) katakana words,
where we insert hyphens between each katakana
character for enhanced readability.
The basis
of our transliteration method is analogous to
that for compound word translation described
in Section 3.2.
The formula for the source
word and one transliteration candidate are rep-
resented as below.
S
=
s1, s2, . . . , sn
T
=
t1, t2, . . . , tn
However, unlike the case of compound word
translation, si and ti denote i-th “symbols”
(which consist of one or more letters), respec-
tively.
Note that we consider only such T’s
that are indexed in the inverted ﬁle, because
our transliteration method often outputs a num-
ber of incorrect words with great probabilities.
Then, we compute P(T|S) for each T using
Equations (1) and (2) (see Section 3.2), and
select k-best candidates with greater probabili-
ties. The crucial content here is the way to pro-
duce a bilingual dictionary for symbols. For this
purpose, we used approximately 3,000 katakana
entries and their English translations listed in
our base word dictionary. To illustrate our dic-
tionary production method, we consider Fig-
ure 2 again.
Looking at this ﬁgure, one may
notice that the ﬁrst letter in each katakana
character tends to be contained in its corre-
sponding English word. However, there are a
few exceptions.
A typical case is that since
Japanese has no distinction between “L” and
“R” sounds, the two English sounds collapse
into the same Japanese sound.
In addition,
a single English letter corresponds to multiple
katakana characters, such as “x” to “ki-su” in
“<text, te-ki-su-to>”. To sum up, English and

romanized katakana words are not exactly iden-
tical, but similar to each other.

Figure 2: Examples of English-katakana corre-
spondence
We ﬁrst manually deﬁne the similarity be-
tween the English letter e and the ﬁrst roman-
ized letter for each katakana character j, as
shown in Table 1. In this table, “phonetically
similar” letters refer to a certain pair of letters,
such as “L” and “R”4. We then consider the
similarity for any possible combination of let-
ters in English and romanized katakana words,
which can be represented as a matrix, as shown
in Figure 3.
This ﬁgure shows the similarity
between letters in “<text, te-ki-su-to>”.
We
put a dummy letter “$”, which has a positive
similarity only to itself, at the end of both En-
glish and katakana words. One may notice that
matching plausible symbols can be seen as ﬁnd-
ing the path which maximizes the total similar-
ity from the ﬁrst to last letters. The best path
can easily be found by, for example, Dijkstra’s
algorithm (Dijkstra, 1959).
From Figure 3,
we can derive the following correspondences:
“<te, te>”, “<x, ki-su>” and “<t, to>”. The
resultant correspondences contain 944 Japanese
and 790 English symbol types, from which we
also estimated P(si|ti) and P(ti+1|ti).
As can be predicted, a preliminary experi-
ment showed that our transliteration method
is not accurate when compared with a word-
based translation. For example, the Japanese
word “re-ji-su-ta (register)” is transliterated to
“resister”, “resistor” and “register”, with the
probability score in descending order.
How-

ically similar letters.
ever, combined with the compound word trans-
lation, irrelevant transliteration outputs are ex-
pected to be discarded. For example, a com-
pound word like “re-ji-su-ta tensou gengo (reg-
ister transfer language)” is successfully trans-
lated, given a set of base words “tensou (trans-
fer)” and “gengo (language)” as a context.

Evaluation
This section investigates the performance of our
CLIR system based on the TREC-type evalu-
ation methodology: the system outputs 1,000
top documents, and TREC evaluation software
is used to calculate the recall-precision trade-oﬀ
and 11-point average precision.
For the purpose of our evaluation, we used
the NACSIS test collection (Kando et al., 1998).
This collection consists of 21 Japanese queries
and approximately 330,000 documents (in ei-

ther a combination of English and Japanese or
either of the languages individually), collected
from technical papers published by 65 Japanese
associations for various ﬁelds. Each document
consists of the document ID, title, name(s) of
author(s), name/date of conference, hosting or-
ganization, abstract and keywords, from which
titles, abstracts and keywords were used for our
evaluation. We used as target documents ap-
proximately 187,000 entries where abstracts are
in both English and Japanese. Each query con-
sists of the title of the topic, description, narra-
tive and list of synonyms, from which we used
only the description. Roughly speaking, most
topics are related to electronic, information and
control engineering. Figure 4 shows example de-
scriptions (translated into English by one of the
authors). Relevance assessment was performed
based on one of the three ranks of relevance,
i.e., “relevant”, “partially relevant” and “irrel-
evant”. In our evaluation, relevant documents
refer to both “relevant” and “partially relevant”
documents5.

Evaluation of compound word
translation
We compared the following query translation
methods:
(1) a control, in which all possible translations
derived from the (original) EDR technical
terminology dictionary are used as query
terms (“EDR”),
(2) all possible base word translations derived
from our dictionary are used (“all”),
5The result did not signiﬁcantly change depending on
whether we regarded “partially relevant” as relevant or
not.
(3) randomly selected k translations derived
from our bilingual dictionary are used
(“random”),
(4) k-best
translations
through
compound
word translation are used (“CWT”).
For system “EDR”, compound words unlisted in
the EDR dictionary were manually segmented
so that substrings (shorter compound words or
base words) can be translated.
For both sys-
tems “random” and “CWT”, we arbitrarily set
k = 3. Figure 5 and Table 2 show the recall-
precision curve and 11-point average precision
for each method, respectively. In these, “J-J”
refers to the result obtained by the Japanese-
Japanese IR system, which uses as documents
Japanese titles/abstracts/keywords comparable
to English ﬁelds in the NACSIS collection. This
can be seen as the upper bound for CLIR perfor-
mance6. Looking at these results, we can con-
clude that the dictionary production and prob-
abilistic translation methods we proposed are
eﬀective for CLIR.

Evaluation of transliteration
In the NACSIS collection, three queries con-
tain katakana (base) words unlisted in our bilin-
gual dictionary.
Those words are “ma-i-ni-
n-gu (mining)” and “ko-ro-ke-i-sho-n (colloca-
tion)”. However, to emphasize the eﬀectiveness
of transliteration, we compared the following ex-
treme cases:
(1) a control, in which every katakana word is
discarded from queries (“control”),
(2) a case where transliteration is applied to
every katakana word and top 10 candidates
are used (“translit”).
Both cases use system “CWT” in Section 4.1.
In the case of “translit”, we do not use katakana
entries listed in the base word dictionary. Fig-
ure 6 and Table 3 show the recall-precision curve
and 11-point average precision for each case, re-
spectively. In these, results for “CWT” corre-
spond to those in Figure 5 and Table 2, respec-
tively. We can conclude that our transliteration
method signiﬁcantly improves the baseline per-
formance (i.e., “control”), and comparable to
word-based translation in terms of CLIR per-
formance.
An interesting observation is that the use of
transliteration is robust against typos in docu-
ments, because a number of similar strings are
used as query terms. For example, our translit-
eration method produced the following strings
for “ri-da-ku-sho-n (reduction)”:
riduction, redction, redaction, reduc-
tion.
All of these words are eﬀective for retrieval, be-
cause they are contained in the target docu-
ments.

Evaluation of the overall
performance
We compared our system (“CWT+translit”)
with the Japanese-Japanese IR system, where
(unlike the evaluation in Section 4.2) transliter-
ation was applied only to “ma-i-ni-n-gu (min-
ing)” and “ko-ro-ke-i-sho-n (collocation)”. Fig-
ure 7 and Table 4 show the recall-precision curve
and 11-point average precision for each sys-
tem, respectively, from which one can see that
our CLIR system is quite comparable with the
monolingual IR system in performance. In ad-
dition, from Figure 5 to 7, one can see that the
monolingual system generally performs better

at lower recall while the CLIR system performs
better at higher recall.
For further investigation, let us discuss sim-
ilar experimental results reported by Kando
and Aizawa (1998), where a bilingual dictionary
produced from Japanese/English keyword pairs
in the NACSIS documents is used for query
translation.
Their evaluation method is al-
most the same as performed in our experiments.
One diﬀerence is that they use the “OpenText”
search engine7, and thus the performance for
Japanese-Japanese IR is higher than obtained
in our evaluation.
However, the performance
of their Japanese-English CLIR systems, which
is roughly 50-60% of that for their Japanese-
Japanese IR system, is comparable with our
CLIR system performance. It is expected that
using a more sophisticated search engine, our
CLIR system will achieve a higher performance
than that obtained by Kando and Aizawa.

method. Our experimental results showed that
compound word translation and transliteration
methods individually improve on the baseline
performance, and when used together the im-
provement is even greater. Future work will in-
clude the application of automatic word align-
ment methods (Fung, 1995; Smadja et al., 1996)
to enhance the dictionary.
