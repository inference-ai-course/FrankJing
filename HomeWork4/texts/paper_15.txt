Introduction
This paper argues that an interlingual representation
must explicitly represent some parts of the meaning of
a situation as possibilities (or preferences), not as neces-
sary or deﬁnite components of meaning (or constraints).
Possibilities enable the analysis and generation of nu-
ance, something required for faithful translation. Fur-
thermore, the representation of the meaning of words is
crucial, because it speciﬁes which nuances words can
convey in which contexts.
In translation it is rare to ﬁnd the exact word that
faithfully and directly translates a word of another lan-
guage.
Often, the target language will provide many
near-synonyms for a source language word that differ
(from the target word and among themselves) in nuances
of meaning. For example, the French fournir could be
translated as provide, supply, furnish, offer, volunteer, af-
ford, bring, and so on, which differ in ﬁne-grained as-
pects of denotation, emphasis, and style. (Figures 1 and 2
show some of the distinctions.) But none of these options
may carry the right nuances to match those conveyed by
fournir in the source text; unwanted extra nuances may
be conveyed, or a desired nuance may be left out. Since
an exact match is probably impossible in many situa-
tions, faithful translation will require uncovering the nu-
ances conveyed by a source word and then determining
how the nuances can be conveyed in the target language
by appropriate word choices in any particular context.
The inevitable mismatches that occur are one type of
translation mismatch—differences of meaning, but not
of form, in the source and target language (Kameyama
et al., 1991).1
1A separate class of difference, translation divergence, involves dif-
ferences in the form of the source and target texts and results from
lexical gaps in the target language (in which no single word lexical-
izes the meaning of a source word), and from syntactic and colloca-
tional constraints imposed by the source language. ‘Paraphrasing’ the
source text in the target language is required in order to preserve the
meaning as much as possible (Dorr, 1994; Stede, 1996; Elhadad et al.,
1997). But even when paraphrasing, choices between near-synonyms
will have to be made, so, clearly, translation mismatches and translation
divergences are not independent phenomena. Just as standard semantic
content can be incorporated or spread around in different ways, so can
nuances of meaning.
Provide may suggest foresight and stress the idea of making
adequate preparation for something by stocking or ship-
ping . . .
Supply may stress the idea of replacing, of making up what is
needed, or of satisfying a deﬁciency.
Furnish may emphasize the idea of ﬁtting something or some-
one with whatever is necessary, or sometimes, normal or
desirable.

nary of Synonyms (Gove, 1973).
Offer and volunteer may both refer to a generous extending
of aid, services, or a desired item. Those who volunteer
agree by free choice rather than by submission to selec-
tion or command.

Word (Hayakawa, 1994).

Near-synonyms across languages
This section examines how near-synonyms can differ
within and across languages. I will discuss some of the
speciﬁc problems of lexical representation in an interlin-
gual MT system using examples drawn from the French
and English versions of the multi-lingual text provided
for this workshop.
To be as objective as possible, I’ll rely on several
dictionaries of synonym discrimination including, for
English, Gove (1973) and Hayakawa (1994), and for
French, Bailly (1970), B´enac (1956), and Batchelor and
Offord (1993). Unless otherwise stated, the information
on differences below comes from one of these reference
books.
Notation: Below, ‘english :: french’ indicates that the
pair of words or expressions english and french corre-
spond to one another in the multi-lingual text (i.e., they
are apparent translations of each other).
Fine-grained denotational mismatches
If a word has near-synonyms, then they most likely
differ in ﬁne-grained aspects of denotation. Consider the
following pairs:

1.
provides :: fournit
2.
provided :: apportaient
3.
provide :: offrir
4.
brought :: fournissait
5.
brought :: se chargeait
These all share the basic meaning of giving or mak-
ing available what is needed by another, but each adds
its own nuances.
And these are not the only words
that the translator could have used: in English, furnish,
supply, offer, and volunteer would have been possibil-
ities; in French, approvisionner, munir, pourvoir, nan-
tir, pr´esenter, among others, could have been chosen.
The differences are complex and often language-speciﬁc.
Figures 1 and 2 discuss some of the differences between
the English words, and ﬁgures 3 and 4 those between
the French words. And this is the problem for transla-
tion: none of the words match up exactly, and the nu-
ances they carry when they are actually used are context-
dependent. (Also notice that the usage notes are vague in
many cases, using words like ‘may’ and ‘id´ee’.)
Consider this second example:
6a.
began :: amorc´e
b.
began :: commenc¸a
c.
started :: au d´ebut
Amorcer implies a beginning that prepares for something
else; there is no English word that carries the same nu-
ance, but begin appears to be the closest match. Com-
mencer also translates as begin, although commencer is
a general word in French, implying only that the thing
begun has a duration. In English, begin differs from start
in that the latter can imply a setting out from a certain
point after inaction (in opposition to stop).
More pairings that exhibit similar ﬁne-grained denota-
tional differences include these:
7a.
broaden :: ´elargir
b.
expand :: ´etendre
c.
increase :: accroˆıtre
8a.
transformation :: passer
b.
transition :: transition
9.
enable:: permettre
10.
opportunities:: perspectives
11.
assistance :: assistance
There are two main problems in representing the
meanings of these words. First, although some of the
nuances could be represented by simple features, such as
‘foresight’ or ‘generous’, most of them cannot because
they are complex and have an ‘internal’ structure. They
are concepts that relate aspects of the situation. For ex-
ample, for furnish, ‘ﬁtting someone with what is nec-
essary’ is not a simple feature; it involves a concept of
Fourni a rapport `a la quantit´e et ce dit de ce qui `a sufﬁsamment
ou en abondance le n´ecessaire.
Muni et arm´e sont relatifs `a l’´etat d’une chose rendue forte ou
capable, muni, plus g´en´erale, annonc¸ant un secours pour
faire quoi que ce soit.
Pourvu comporte un id´ee de pr´ecaution et ce dit bien en par-
lant des avantages naturels donn´es par une sorte de ﬁnalit´e
. . .
Nanti, muni d’un gage donn´e par un d´ebiteur `a son cr´eancier,
par ext. muni par pr´ecaution et, absolumment, assez en-
richi pour ne pas craindre l’avenir.
Figure 3: An abridged entry from B´enac (1956).
Offrir, c’est faire hommage d’une chose `a quelqu’un, en man-
ifestant le d´esir qu’il l’accepte, aﬁn que l’offre devienne
un don.
Pr´esenter, c’est offrir une chose que l’on tient `a la main ou
qui est l`a sous les yeux et dont la personne peut `a l’instant
prendre possession.
Figure 4: An abridged entry from Bailly (1970).
‘ﬁtting’, a patient (the same patient that the overall sit-
uation has), a thing that is provided, and the idea of
the necessity of that thing to someone. Thus, many nu-
ances must be represented as fully-ﬂedged concepts (or
instances thereof) in an interlingua.
Second, many of the nuances are merely suggested or
implied, if they are conveyed at all. That is, they are
conveyed indirectly—the reader has the license to decide
that such a nuance was unintended—and as such are not
necessary conditions for the deﬁnition of the words. This
has ramiﬁcations for both the analysis of the source text
and the generation of the target text because one has to
determine how strongly a certain nuance is intended, if at
all (in the source), and then how it should be conveyed,
if it can be, in the target language. One should seek to
translate indirect expressions as such, and avoid making
them direct. One must also avoid choosing a target word
that might convey an unwanted implication. In any case,
aspects of word meaning that are indirect must be repre-
sented as such in the lexicon.
Coarse-grained denotational mismatches
Sometimes the translator chooses a target word that is se-
mantically quite different from the source word, yet still
conveys the same basic idea. Considering pair 5, above:
bring seems to mean to carry as a contribution, and se
charger to take responsibility for.
Perhaps there are
no good equivalents in the opposite languages for these
terms, or alternatively, the words might have been cho-
sen because of syntactic or collocational preferences—
they co-occur with leadership :: l’administration, which
are not close translations either.
In fact, the desire to use natural-sounding syntactic

and collocational structures is probably responsible for
many of these divergences. In another case, the pair fac-
tors :: raisons occurs perhaps because the translator did
not want to literally translate the expressions Many fac-
tors contributed to :: Parmi les raisons de.
Such mis-
matches are outside the scope of this paper, because they
fall more into the area of translation divergences. (See
Smadja et al. (1996) for research on translating colloca-
tions.)
Stylistic mismatches
Words can also differ on many stylistic dimensions, but
formality is the most recognized dimension.2 Consider
the following pairs:
12a.
plans :: entend bien
b.
plan :: envisagent de
While the French words differ in formality (entend bien
is formal, and envisagent de is neutral), the same word
was chosen in English. Note that the other French words
that could have been chosen also differ in formality: se
proposent de has intermediate formality, and comptent,
avont l’intention, and proj`etent de are all neutral.
Similarly, in 6, above, amorcer is more formal than
commencer. Considering the other near-synonyms: the
English commence and initiate are quite formal, as is the
French initier. D´ebuter and d´emarrer are informal, yet
both are usually translated by begin, a neutral word in
English. (Notice also that the French cognate of the for-
mal English commence, commencer, is neutral.)
Style, which can be conveyed by both the words and
the structure of a text, is best represented as a global
property in an interlingual representation. That way, it
can inﬂuence all decisions that are made. (It is probably
not always necessary to preserve the style of particular
words across languages.)
A separate issue of style in this text is its use of techni-
cal or domain-speciﬁc vocabulary. Consider the follow-
ing terms used to refer to the subject of the text:
13a.
institution :: institution
b.
institution :: ´etablissement
c.
institution :: association
d.
joint venture :: association
e.
programme:: association
f.
bank :: ´etablissement
g.
bank :: banque
In French, it appears that association must be used to re-
fer to non-proﬁt companies and ´etablissement or banque
for their regulated (for-proﬁt) counterparts. In English
institution, among other terms, is used for both. Con-
sider also the following pairs:
2Hovy (1988) suggests others including force and ﬂoridity, and Di-
Marco et al. (1993) suggest concreteness or vividness.
Actually, it
seems that the French text is more vivid—if a text on banking can be
considered vivid at all—than the English, using words such as baptis´ee,
´eclatant, contagieux, and d´emunis.
14a.
seed capital :: capital initial
b.
working capital :: fonds de roulement
c.
equity capital:: capital social
Attitudinal mismatches
Words also differ in the attitude that they express. For ex-
ample, of poor :: d´emunis, poor can express a derogatory
attitude, but d´emunis (which can be translated as impov-
erished) probably expresses a neutral attitude. Consider
also people of indigenous background :: Indiens. Atti-
tudes must be included in the interlingual representation
of an expression, and they must refer to the speciﬁc par-
ticipant(s) about whom the speaker is expressing an atti-
tude.

Representing near-synonyms
Before I discuss the requirements of the interlingual rep-
resentation, I must ﬁrst discuss how the knowledge of
near-synonyms ought to be modelled if we are to account
for the complexities of word meaning in an interlingua.
In the view taken here, the lexicon is given the central
role as bridge between natural language and interlingua.
The conventional model of lexical knowledge, used
in many computational systems, is not suitable for rep-
resenting the ﬁne-grained distinctions between near-
synonyms (Hirst, 1995).
In the conventional model,
knowledge of the world is represented by ostensibly
language-neutral concepts that are often organized as an
ontology. The denotation of a lexical item is represented
as a concept, or a conﬁguration of concepts, and amounts
to a direct word-to-concept link. So except for polysemy
and (absolute) synonymy, there is no logical difference
between a lexical item and a concept. Therefore, words
that are nearly synonymous have to be linked each to
their own slightly different concepts. The problem comes
in trying to represent these slightly different concepts and
the relationships between them. Hirst (1995) shows that
one ends up with an awkward proliferation of language-
dependent concepts, contrary to the interlingual function
of the ontology. And this assumes we can even build a
representative taxonomy from a set of near-synonyms to
begin with.
Moreover, the denotation of a word is taken to em-
body the necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for deﬁning
the word. While this has been convenient for text anal-
ysis and lexical choice, since a denotation can be used
as an applicability condition of the word, the model is
inadequate for representing the nuances of meaning that
are conveyed indirectly, which, clearly, are not necessary
conditions.
An alternative representation is suggested by the prin-
ciple behind Gove’s (1973) synonym usage notes. Words
are grouped into a entry if they have the same essential
meaning, i.e., that they “can be deﬁned in the same terms
up to a certain point” (p. 25a) and differ only in terms of
minor ideas involved in their meanings. We combine this
principle with Saussure’s paradigmatic view that “each

Figure 5: The clustered model of lexical knowledge.
of a set of synonyms ... has its particular value only be-
cause they stand in contrast with one another” (Saussure,
1983, p. 114) and envision a representation in which the
meaning of a word arises out of a combination of its es-
sential denotation (shared with other words) and a set of
explicit differences to its near-synonyms.
Thus, I propose a clustered model of lexical knowl-
edge, depicted in ﬁgure 5. A cluster has two levels of
representation: a core concept and peripheral concepts.
The core concept is a denotation as in the conventional
model—a conﬁguration of concepts (that are deﬁned in
the ontology) that functions as a necessary applicabil-
ity condition (for choice)—but it is shared by the near-
synonyms in the cluster. In the ﬁgure, the ontological
concepts are shown as rectangles; in this case all three
clusters denote the concept of MAKING-AVAILABLE. All
of the peripheral concepts that the words may differ
in denoting, suggesting, or emphasizing are also repre-
sented as conﬁgurations of concepts, but they are explic-
itly distinguished from the core concept as indirect mean-
ings that can be conveyed or not depending on the con-
text. In the ﬁgure, the differences between words (in a
single language) are shown as dashed lines; not all words
need be differentiated. Stylistic, attitudinal, and colloca-
tional factors are also encoded in the cluster.
Each language has its own set of clusters.
Corre-
sponding clusters (across languages) need not have the
same peripheral concepts since languages may differen-
tiate their synonyms in entirely different terms. Differ-
ences across languages are represented, for convenience,
by dashed lines between clusters, though these would not
be used in pure interlingual MT. Essentially, a cluster is
a language-speciﬁc formal usage note, an idea originated
by DiMarco et al. (1993) that Edmonds (forthcoming) is
formalizing.

Interlingual representation
Crucially, an interlingual representation should not be
tied to any particular linguistic structure, whether lexi-
cal or syntactic.
Assuming that one has constructed an ontology or do-
main model (of language-neutral concepts), an interlin-
gual representation of a situation is, for us, an instan-
tiation of part of the domain knowledge. Both Stede
(1996) and Elhadad et al. (1997) have developed such
formalisms for representing the input to natural language
generation applications (the former to multilingual gen-
eration), but they are applicable to interlingual MT as
well. The formalisms allow their applications to para-
phrase the same input in many ways including realiz-

ing information at different syntactic ranks and cover-
ing/incorporating the input in different ways. For them,
generation is a matter of satisfying two types of con-
straints: (1) covering the whole input structure with a set
of word denotations (thereby choosing the words), and
(2) building a well-formed syntactic structure out of the
words. But while their systems can provide many options
to choose from, they lack the complementary ability to
actually choose which is the most appropriate.
Now, ﬁnding the most appropriate translation of a
word involves a tradeoff between many possibly conﬂict-
ing desires to express certain nuances in certain ways,
to establish the right style, to observe collocational pref-
erences, and to satisfy syntactic constraints. This sug-
gests that lexical choice is not a matter of satisfying con-
straints (i.e., of using the necessary applicability condi-
tions of a word), but rather of attempting to meet a large
set of preferences. Thus, a distinction must be made be-
tween knowledge that should be treated as preferences as
opposed to constraints in the interlingual representation.
In the generation stage of MT, one attempts to choose
the near-synonym from a cluster (activated because of
the constraints) whose peripheral concepts best meet the
most preferences.
Turning to the analysis stage of MT, since many nu-
ances are expressed indirectly and are inﬂuenced by the
context, one cannot know for sure whether they have
been expressed unless one performs a very thorough
analysis. Indeed, it might not be possible for even a thor-
ough analysis to decide whether a nuance was expressed,
or how indirectly it was expressed, given the context-
dependent nature of word meaning. Thus, on the basis of
the knowledge of what words can express, stored in the
clusters, the analysis stage would output an interlingual
representation that includes possibilities of what was ex-
pressed. The possibilities then become preferences dur-
ing generation.

Examples
Figures 6–9 give examples of interlingual representations
for four segments of the text that involve some of the
words discussed in section 2. Since my focus is on word
meanings, I will not give complete representations of the
expressions. Also note that while I use speciﬁc ontologi-
cal concepts in these descriptions, this in no way implies
that I claim these are the right concepts to represent—in
fact, some are quite crude. A good ontology is crucial
to MT, and I assume that such an ontology will in due
course be constructed.
I have used attribute-value structures, but any equiv-
alent formalism would do. Square brackets enclose re-
cursive structures of instantiations of ontological con-
cepts. Names of instances are in lowercase; concepts
are capitalized; relations between instances are in up-
percase; and cross-reference is indicated by a digit in
a square.
A whole interlingual representation is sur-
rounded by brace brackets and consists of exactly one
speciﬁcation of the situation and any number of possi-
bilities, attitudes, and stylistic preferences. The ‘situa-
tion’ encodes the information one might ﬁnd in a tradi-
tional interlingual representation—the deﬁnite portion of
meaning to be expressed. A ‘possibility’ takes as a value
a four-part structure of (1) frequency (never, sometimes,
or always), which represents the degree of possibility;
(2) strength (weak, medium, or strong), which represents
how strongly the nuance is conveyed; (3) type (emphasis,
suggestion, implication, or denotation), which represents
how the nuance is conveyed; and (4) an instance of a con-
cept. The ‘style’ and ‘attitude’ attributes should be self-
explanatory. As for content, some of the meanings were
discussed in section 2, and the rest are derived from the
aforementioned dictionaries. Comments (labelled with
‘%’) are included to indicate which words gave rise to
which possibilities.

Conclusion
This paper has motivated the need to represent possibili-
ties (or preferences) in addition to necessary components
(or constraints) in the interlingual representation of a sit-
uation. Possibilities are required because words can con-
vey a myriad of sometimes indirect nuances of meaning
depending on the context. Some examples of how one
could represent possibilities were given.
