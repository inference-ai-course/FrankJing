Abstract
Particles fullﬁll several distinct central roles in the Japanese language. They can mark arguments as well as
adjuncts, can be functional or have semantic funtions. There is, however, no straightforward matching from
particles to functions, as, e.g., ga can mark the subject, the object or an adjunct of a sentence. Particles
can cooccur.
Verbal arguments that could be identiﬁed by particles can be eliminated in the Japanese
sentence. And ﬁnally, in spoken language particles are often omitted. A proper treatment of particles is
thus necessary to make an analysis of Japanese sentences possible. Our treatment is based on an empirical
investigation of 800 dialogues. We set up a type hierarchy of particles motivated by their subcategorizational
and modiﬁcational behaviour. This type hierarchy is part of the Japanese syntax in VERBMOBIL.
1
Introduction
The treatment of particles is essential for the processing of the Japanese language for two reasons. The
ﬁrst reason is that these are the words that occur most frequently.
The second reason is that particles
have various central functions in the Japanese syntax: case particles mark subcategorized verbal arguments,
postpositions mark adjuncts and have semantic attributes, topic particles mark topicalized phrases and no
marks an attributive nominal adjunct. Their treatment is diﬃcult for three reasons: 1) despite their central
position in Japanese syntax the omission of particles occurs quite often in spoken language. 2) One particle
can fulﬁll more than one function. 3) Particles can cooccur, but not in an arbitrary way.
In order to set up a grammar that accounts for a larger amount of spoken language, a comprehensive
investigation of Japanese particles is thus necessary. Such a comprehensive investigation of Japanese particles
was missing up to now. Two kinds of solutions have previously been proposed: (1) the particles are divided
into case particles and postpositions. The latter build the heads of their phrases, while the former do not (cf.
[6], [12]). (2) All kinds of particles build the head of their phrases and have the same lexical structure (cf.
[1]). Both kinds of analyses lead to problems: if postpositions are heads, while case particles are nonheads,
a suﬃcient treatment of those cases where two or three particles occur sequentially is not possible, as we
will show. If on the other hand there is no distinction of particles, it is not possible to encode their diﬀerent
behaviour in subcategorization and modiﬁcation. We carried out an empirical investigation of cooccurrences
of particles in Japanese spoken language. As a result, we could set up restrictions for 25 particles. We show
that the problem is essentially based at the lexical level. Instead of assuming diﬀerent phrase structure rules
we state a type hierarchy of Japanese particles. This makes a uniform treatment of phrase structure as well
as a diﬀerentiation of subcategorization patterns possible. We therefore adopt the ‘all-head’ analysis, but
extend it by a type hierarchy in order to be able to diﬀerentiate between the particles. Our analysis is based
on 800 Japanese dialogues of the VERBMOBIL data concerning appointment scheduling.

The Type Hierarchy of Japanese Particles
Japanese noun phrases can be modiﬁed by more than one particle at a time. There are many examples in our
data where two or three particles occur sequentially. On the one hand, this phenomenon must be accounted
for in order to attain a correct processing of the data. On the other hand, the discrimination of particles is

motivated by their modiﬁcational and subcategorizational behaviour. We carried out an empirical analysis,
based on our dialogue data. Table 1 shows the frequency of cooccurrence of two particles in the dialogue data.
There is a tendency to avoid the cooccurrence of particles with the same phonology, even if it is possible in
principal in some cases. The reason is obvious: such sentences are diﬃcult to understand.

Table 1: Cooccurrence of 2 Particles in the 800 Dialogues
[4] treats wa, ga, wo, ni, de, to, made, kara and ya as ‘particles’. They are divided into those that are in the
deep structure and those that are introduced through transformations. An example for the former is kara,
examples for the latter are ga(SBJ), wo(OBJ), ga(OBJ) and ni(OBJ2). [1] assigns all particles the part-of-
speech P. Examples are ga, wo, ni, no, de, e, kara and made. All particles are heads of their phrases. Verbal
arguments get a grammatical relation [GR OBJ/SBJ]. In [2] the part-of-speech class P contains only ga, wo
and ni. [12] deﬁnes postpositions and case particles such that postpositions are the Japanese counterpart
of prepositions in English and cannot stand independently, while case particles assign case and can follow
postpositions. Her case particles include ga, wo, ni, no and wa. [7] divides case markers (ga, wo, ni and
wa) from copula forms (ni, de, na and no). He argues that ni, de, na and no are the inﬁnitive, gerund and
adnominal forms of the copula.
In the class of particles, we include case particles, complementizers, modifying particles and conjunctional
particles. We thus assume a common class of the several kinds of particles introduced by the other authors.
But they are further divided into subclasses, as can be seen in ﬁgure 1. We assume not only a diﬀerentiation
between case particles and postpositions, but a ﬁner graded distinction that includes diﬀerent kinds of particles
not mentioned by the other authors. de is assumed to be a particle and not a copula, as [7] proposes. It
belongs to the class of adverbial particles. One major motivation for the type hierarchy is the observation we
made of the cooccurrence of particles. Case particles (ga, wo, ni) are those that attach to verbal arguments.
A complementizer marks complement sentences. Modifying particles attach to adjuncts. They are further
divided into noun-modifying particles and verb-modifying particles. Verb modifying particles can be topic
particles, adverbial particles, or postpositions.
Some particles can have more than one function, as for
example ni has the function of a case particle and an adverbial particle. Figure 1 shows the type hierarchy
of Japanese particles. The next sections examine the individual types of particles.

2.1
Case Particles
There is no number nor gender agreement between noun phrase and verb. The verbs assign case to the noun
phrases. This is marked by the case particles. Therefore these have a syntactic function, but not a semantic
one. Unlike in English, the grammatical functions cannot be assigned through positions in the sentence or
c-command-relations, since Japanese exhibits no ﬁxed word position for verbal arguments. The assignment
of the grammatical function is not expressed by the case particle alone but only in connection with the verbal
valency. There are verbs that require ga-marked objects, while in most cases the ga-marked argument is the
subject:
(1)
nantoka
somehow
yotei
time
ga
GA
toreru
can take
N desu
COP
ga
SAP
(Somehow (I) can ﬁnd some time.)
Japanese is described as a head-ﬁnal language. [1] therefore assumes only one phrase structure rule: Mother
−→Daughter Head. However, research literature questions whether this also applies to nominal phrases and
their case particles. [9]:45 assume Japanese case particles to be markers.
On the one hand, there are several reasons to distinguish case particles and modifying particles. On the
other hand, I doubt whether it is reasonable to assume diﬀerent phrase structures for NP+case particle
and NP+modifying particle. The phrase-structural distinction of case particles and postpositions leads to
problems, when more than one particle occur. The following example comes from the Verbmobil corpus:
(2)
naNji
what time
kara
from
ga
GA
yoroshii
good
desu
COP
ka
QUE
(At what time would you like to start?)
If one now assumes that the modifying particle kara is head of naNji as well as of the case particle ga, the
result for naNji kara ga with the head-marker structure described in [9]1 would be as shown in ﬁgure 2.
The case particle ga would have to allow nouns and modifying particles in SPEC. The latter are however
normally adjuncts that modify verbal projections. Therefore the head of kara entails the information that
it can modify a verb. This information is inherited to the head of the whole phrase by the Head-Feature
Principle as is to be seen in the tree above. As a result, this is also admitted as an adjunct to a verb, which
leads to wrong analyses for sentences like the following one:
(3)
*naNji
what time
kara
from
ga
GA
sochira
you
ga
GA
jikaN
time
ga
GA
toremasu
can take
ka
QUE
If, on the other hand, case particles and topic markers are heads, one receives a consistent and correct
processing of this kind of example too. This is because the head information [MOD none] is given from the
particle ga to the head of the phrase naNji kara ga. Thus this phrase is not admitted as an adjunct.
Instead of assuming diﬀerent phrase structure rules, a distinction of the kinds of particles can be based on
lexical types. HPSG oﬀers the possibility to deﬁne a common type and to set up speciﬁcations for the diﬀerent
types of particles. We assume Japanese to be head-ﬁnal in this respect. All kinds of particles are analysed
1The Marking Principle says: In a headed phrase, the MARKING value is token-identical with that of the MARKER-
DAUGHTER if any, and with that of the HEAD-DAUGHTER otherwise[9].

as heads of their phrases. The relation between case particle and nominal phrase is a ‘Complement-Head’
relation. The complement is obligatory and adjacent2. Normally the case particle ga marks the subject, the
case particle wo the direct object and the case particle ni the indirect object. There are, however, many
exceptions. We therefore use predicate-argument-structures instead of a direct assignment of grammatical
functions by the particles (and possibly transformations). The valency information of the Japanese verbs
does not only contain the syntactic category and the semantic restrictions of the subcategorized arguments,
but also the case particles they must be annotated with3.
In most cases the ga-marked noun phrase is the subject of the sentence. However, this is not always the case.
Notably stative verbs subcategorize for ga-marked objects. An example is the stative verb dekimasu4:
(4)
kanojo
she
ga
GA
oyogi
swimming
ga
GA
dekimasu
can
(She can swim.)
These and other cases are sometimes called ‘double-subject constructions’ in the literature. But these ga-
marked noun phrases do not behave like subjects. They are neither subject to restrictions on subject hon-
oriﬁcation nor subject to reﬂexive binding by the subject. This can be shown by the following example:
(5)
gogo
afternoon
no
NO
hou
side
ga
GA
yukkuri
at ease
hanashi
talking
ga
GA
dekimasu
can
ne
SAP
(We can talk at ease in the afternoon.)
hanashi does not meet the semantic restriction [+animate] stated by the verb dekimasu for its subject. There
are even ga-marked adjuncts. [5] assumes these ‘double-subject constructions’ to be derived from genitive
relations. But this analysis seems not to be true for example 5), because the following sentence is wrong:
(6)
*gogo
afternoon
no
NO
hou
side
no
NO
yukkuri
at ease
hanashi
talk
ga
GA
dekimasu
can
ne
SAP
The case particle wo normally marks the direct object of the sentence. In contrast to ga, no two phrases in
one clause may be marked by wo. This restriction is called ‘double-wo constraint’ in research literature (see,
for example, [12]:249ﬀ.). Object positions with wo-marking as well as subject positions with ga-marking can
be saturated only once. There are neither double subjects nor double objects. This restriction is also valid
for indirect objects. Arguments found must be assigned a saturated status in the subcategorization frame, so
that they cannot be saturated again (as in English). The verbs subcategorize for at most one subject, object
and indirect object. Only one of these arguments may be marked by wo, while a subject and an object may
both be marked by ga. These attributes are determined by the verbal valency. The wo-marked argument
is not required to be adjacent to the verb. It is possible to reverse NP-ga and NP-wo as well as to insert
adjuncts between the arguments and the verb.
The particle ni can have the function of a case particle as well as that of an adjunct particle modifying
the predicate. [10] also identify homophoneous ni that can mark adjuncts or complements. They use the
notion of ‘aﬀectedness’ to distinguish them. This is however not useful in our domain. [8] suggest testing the
possibility of passivization. Some verbs subcategorize for a ni-marked object, as for example naru:
(7)
raigetsu
next month
ni
NI
naru
become
N desu
COP
ga
SAP
(It will be next month.)
ni-marked objects cannot occur twice in the same clause, just as ga-marked subjects and wo-marked objects.
The ‘double-wo constraint’ is neither a speciﬁc Japanese restriction nor a speciﬁc peculiarity of the Japanese
direct object. It is based on the wrong assumption that grammatical functions are assigned by case particles.
There are a lot of examples with double NP-ni, but these are adjuncts.
The lexical entries of case particles get a case entry in the HEAD. Possible values are ga, wo, ni and to. They
are neither adjuncts nor speciﬁers and thus get the entries [MOD none] and [SPEC none]. They subcategorize
for an adjacent object. This can be a noun, a postposition or an adverbial particle5.
2Obligatory Japanese arguments are always adjacent, and vice versa.
3[8] investigates the particles ni, ga and wo and also states that grammatical functions must be clearly distinguished from
surface cases
4see [4] for a semantic classiﬁcation of verbs that take ga-objects
5A fundamental diﬀerence between Japanese grammar and English grammar is the fact that verbal arguments can be optional.
For example, subjects and objects that refer to the speaker are omitted in most cases in spoken language. The verbal arguments
can freely scramble. Additionally, there exist adjacent verbal arguments. To account for this, our subcategorization contains the
attributes SAT and VAL. In SAT it is noted, whether a verbal argument is already saturated (such that it cannot be saturated
again), optional or adjacent. VAL contains the agreement information for the verbal argument. Adjacency must be checked in
every rule that combines heads and arguments or adjuncts.

to in these cases is categorized as a complementizer. Another possibility is that to marks an adjunct to a
predicate, which qualiﬁes to as a verb modifying particle:

(I would like to organize an exhibition with Prof. Shimizu.)
Finally, the complementizer to can be an NP conjunction (which will not be considered at the moment, see [4]).
The complementizer gets a case entry, because its head is a subtype of case-particle-head. It subcategorizes
for a noun, a verb, an utterance, an adverbial particle or a postposition.
2.3
Modifying Particles
An essential problem is to ﬁnd criteria for the distinction of case particles and modifying particles. On the
semantic level they can be distinguished in that modifying particles introduce semantics, while case particles
have a functional meaning. According to this, the particle no is a modifying one, because it introduces
attributive meaning, as opposed to ([12]:134), who classiﬁes it as a case particle. Another distinctive criterion
that is introduced by [12]:135 says that modifying particles6 are obligatory in spoken language, while case
particles can be omitted.
Case particles are indeed suppressed more often, but there are also cases of
suppressed modifying particles. These occur mainly in temporal expressions in our dialogue data:
(11)
soredewa
then

NO

de
DE
o machi
HON-wait
shite

orimasu
AUX-HON
(I will then wait in the lobby at 2 o’clock on the 14th.)
Finally [12] gives the criterion that case particles can follow modifying particles while modifying particles
cannot follow case particles. This criterion in particular implies that a ﬁner distinction is necessary, as we
have shown that it is not that easy. This can be realized with HPSG types. According to this criterion, no
behaves like a modifying particle, while according to the criterion on meaning, it behaves like a case particle.
Our ﬁrst distinction is thus a functional one: modifying particles diﬀer from case particles in that their
marked entities are not subcategorized for by the verb. Case particles get the head information [CASE case]
that controls agreement between verbs and their arguments. Modifying particles do not get this entry. They
get the information in MOD that they can become adjuncts to verbs (verb modifying particles) or nouns
(the noun modifying particle no) and semantic information. They subcategorize for a noun, as all particles
do. The modifying particles share the following features in their lexical entries.
6He calls them ‘postpositions’.

2.3.1
Verb Modifying Particles
The verb modifying particles specify the modiﬁcation of the verb in MOD. The postpositions modify a
(nonauxiliary) verb as an adjunct and subcategorize for a nominal object.
[7] treats ni and de as the
inﬁnitive and the gerund form of the copula. ni is similar to the inﬁnitive form to the extend that it can
take an adverb as its argument (gogo wa furii ni nat-te i-masu – afternoon - WA - free - become). But the
inﬁnitive is clearly distinct from the characteristics of ni, that cannot be used with N desu, cannot mark a
relative sentence (*John ga furii ni koto) and cannot be marked with the complementizer to (*John ga furii
ni to omou). The adjunctive form ‘de’ has both qualities of a gerundive copula and qualities of a particle.
But there is some data that shows diﬀerent behaviour of de and other gerundives. Firstly, it concerns the
cooccurrence possibilities of de and other particles, compared to gerundive forms and particles:
de wa - V-te wa
de mo - V-te mo
de no - V-te no
de ni - *V-te ni
de ga - *V-te ga
de wo - *V-te wo
de de - *V-te de
Secondly, a gerund may modify auxiliaries, e.g. shite kudasai, shite orimasu, but de may not. Additionally
there is something which distinguishes de of a copula: it may not subcategorize for a subject. A word that is
an adjunct to verbs, subcategorizes for an unmarked noun or a postpositional phrase and is subcategorized
for by several particles (see above) ﬁts well into our description of a verb modifying particle. The adverbial
particles ni, de and to subcategorize for a noun or a postposition. As already described, to behaves like an
adverbial particle, too.
2.3.2
The Noun Modifying Particle NO
no is a particle that modiﬁes nominal phrases. This is an attributive modiﬁcation and has a wide range of
meanings.7 [12]:134ﬀ. assigns no to the class of case particles. However, the criteria she sets up to distin-
guish between case particles and postpositions do not apply to this classiﬁcation of no: ﬁrstly, Tsujimura’s
postpositions have their own semantic meaning. Case particles have a functional meaning. no however has
a semantic, namely attributive meaning. Secondly, Tsujimura’s postpositions are obligatory in spoken lan-
guage, case particles are optional. no is as obligatory as kara and made. Finally, Case particles can - as
Tsujimura states - follow postpositions, but postpositions cannot follow case particles. According to this
criterion, no behaves like a case particle. no combines qualities of case particles with those of modifying
particles (which Tsujimura calls ‘postpositions’). This means that a special treatment of this particle is
necessary. The particle no subcategorizes for a noun, as the other particles do. It also modiﬁes a noun. This
separates it from the other modifying particles. The particle no modiﬁes a noun phrase and occurs after a
noun or a verb modifying particle.
2.3.3
Particles of Topicalization
The topic particle wa can mark arguments as well as adjuncts. In the case of argument marking it replaces
the case particle. In the case of adjunct marking it can replace the verb modifying particle or it can occur
after it. On the syntactic level, it has to be decided, whether the topic particle marks an argument or an
adjunct, when it occurs without a verb modifying particle. This is diﬃcult because of the optionality of
verbal arguments in Japanese. If it marks an argument, it has to be decided which grammatical function this
argument has. This problem can often not be solved on the purely syntactic level. Semantic restrictions for
verbal arguments are necessary:
(12)
basho
place
no
NO
hou
side
wa
WA
dou
how
shimashou
shall do
ka
QUE
(How shall we resolve the problem of the place?)
Subject and object of the verb shimashou are suppressed in this example. The sentence can be interpreted as
having a topic adjunct, but no surface subject and object, when using semantic restrictions for the subject
(agentive) and the object (situation).

Figure 5: Topic Particle AVM
[2] analyses Japanese topicalization with a trace that introduces a value in SLASH and the ‘Binding Fea-
ture Principle’ that uniﬁes the value of SLASH with a wa-marked element8. This treatment is similar to
the one introduced by [9] for the treatment of English topicalization. However, Japanese topicalization is
fundamentally diﬀerent from English one. Firstly, it occurs more frequently. Up to 50% of the sentences
are concerned ([15]). Secondly, there are examples where the topic occurs in the middle of the sentence,
unlike the English topics that occur sentence-initially. Thirdly, suppressing of verbal arguments in Japanese
could be called more a rule than an exception in spoken language. The SLASH approach would introduce
traces in almost every sentence. This, in connection with scrambling and suppressed particles, could not be
restricted in a reasonable way. If one follows Gunji’s interpretation of those cases, where the topic-NP can
be interpreted as a noun modifying phrase, a genitive gap has to be assumed. But this leads to assuming a
genitive gap for every NP that is not modiﬁed. Further, genitive modiﬁcation can be iterated. Finally, two
or three occurences of NP-wa are possible in one utterance. Thus, we decided to assign topicalized sentences
the same syntactic structure as non-topicalized sentences and to resolve the problem on the lexical level. The
topic particle is, on the syntactic level, interpreted as a verbal adjunct. The binding to verbal arguments is
left to the semantic interpretation module in VERBMOBIL, see ﬁgure 5.
mo is similar to wa in some aspects. It can mark a predicative adjunct and can follow de and ni. But it can
also follow wa, an adjective and a sentence with question mark:

mo is a particle that has the head of a topic-adverbial particle, but a diﬀerent subcategorization frame than
wa. koso is another topic particle that can occur after nouns, postpositions or adverbial particles.
2.4
Omitted Particles
Some particles can be omitted in Japanese spoken language. Here is an example from the Verbmobil corpus:

(Would the 13th of June suit you?)
This phenomenon can be found frequently in connection with pronouns and temporal expressions in the
domain of appointment scheduling. [3] assumes that exclusively wa can be suppressed. [14] however shows
that there are contexts, where ga, wo or even e can be omitted. He assigns it as ‘phonological deletion’.
[5] analyses omitted wo particles and explains these with linearization: a particle wo can only be omitted,
when it occurs directly before a verb. [14] however gives examples to prove the opposite. It can be observed
that NPs without particles can fulﬁll the functions of a verbal argument or of a verbal adjunct (ex. 14).
We decided to interpret these NPs as verbal adjuncts and to leave the binding to argument positions to the
semantic interpretation. NPs thus get a MOD value that allows them to modify nonauxiliary verbs.
2.5
ga-Adjuncts
One can ﬁnd several examples with ga marked adjuncts in the Verbmobil data. On the level of information
structure it is said that ga marks neutral descriptions or exhaustive descriptions (c.f. [1], [4]). Gunji analyses
these exhaustive descriptions syntactically in the same way as he analyses his ‘type-I topicalization’. They
build adjuncts that control gaps or reﬂexives in the sentence. He views ga marked adjuncts without control

relations as relying on a very specialized context. However, his treatment leads to problems. Firstly, in
all cases, where ga marks a constituent that is subcategorized as ga-marked by the verb, a second reading
is analysed that contains a ga marked adjunct controlling a gap. This is not reasonable. The treatment
of the diﬀerent meaning of ga marking and wa marking belongs to the semantics and not into the phrase
structure. Secondly, this treatment assumes gaps. We already criticized this in connection with topicalization.
Therefore, we do not need reﬂexive control at the moment. However, it contains mostly examples with ga
marked adjuncts without syntactic control relation to the rest of the sentences.
At the level of syntax, we do not decide whether a ga-marked subject or object is a neutral description
or an exhaustive listing. This decision must be based on context information, where it can be ascertained
whether the noun phrase is generic, anaphoric or new. We distinguish occurrences of NP+ga that are verbal
arguments from those that are adjuncts. The examples for ga-marked adjuncts in the Verbmobil dialogues
either describe a temporal entity or a human. All cases found are predicate modifying. To further restrict
exhaustive interpretations, we introduced selectional restrictions for the marked NP, based on observations
in the data.

Conclusion
The syntactic behaviour of Japanese particles has been analysed based on the Verbmobil dialogue data.
We observed 25 diﬀerent particles in 800 dialogues on appointment scheduling.
It has been possible to
set up a type hierarchy of Japanese particles. We have therefore adopted a lexical treatment instead of
a syntactic treatment based on phrase structure. This is based on the diﬀerent kinds of modiﬁcation and
subcategorization that occur with the particles.
We analysed the Japanese particles according to their
cooccurrence potential, their modiﬁcational behaviour and their occurrence in verbal arguments.
We clariﬁed the question which common characteristics and diﬀerences between the individual particles exist.
A classiﬁcation in categories was carried out. After that a model hierarchy could be set up for an HPSG
grammar. The simple distinction into case particles and postpositions was proved to be insuﬃcient. The
assignment of the grammatical function is done by the verbal valency and not directly by the case particles.
The topic particle is ambiguous. Its binding is done by ambiguity and underspeciﬁcation in the lexicon and
not by the Head-Filler Rule as in the HPSG for English ([9]).
The approach presented here is part of the syntactic analysis of Japanese in the Verbmobil machine translation
system. It is implemented in the PAGE parsing system [13]. It has been proved to be essential for the
processing of a large amount of Japanese dialogue data.
Further research concerning coordinating particles (to, ya, toka, yara, ka etc.) and sentence end particles
(ka, node, yo, ne etc.) is necessary.
