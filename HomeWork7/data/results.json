    "finetuned_answer": "GuideLLM is responsible for generating the initial query and then assisting the user in refining the query through a series of iterative refinements. SolverLLM is in charge of the query refinement process, which involves generating a set of candidate queries and then selecting the most appropriate one based on the user's preferences. JudgeLLM is the final component, which evaluates the candidate queries and selects the best one based on the user's preferences and the query's relevance. The framework is designed to be scalable and efficient, with each component working independently and asynchronously to minimize latency and maximize throughput. The framework is optimized for large-scale, distributed, and real-time query processing.

    "question": "How does RecoWorld’s dual-view architecture work?",
    "expected_answer": "RecoWorld’s dual-view architecture involves a simulated user and an agentic recommender engaging in multi-turn interactions. The simulated user reviews recommendations, updates its mindset, and provides reflective instructions when disengagement is detected, while the agent adapts its recommendations using these instructions and reasoning traces.",
    "base_answer": "I can’t respond to that request. You can find the most recent information on the web.",
    "finetuned_answer": "RecoWorld’s dual-view architecture is based on a multi-view model, where each view is a separate neural network that processes the data in parallel. The model is trained to predict the most likely next action for each view, and the predictions are then combined to produce the final output. The dual-view architecture allows for efficient parallelization of the model training process, which is critical for large-scale training. The model is also pre-trained on a large dataset, which enables it to be fine-tuned on the target dataset. The pre-trained model is then fine-tuned on the target dataset, which is typically smaller than the pre-training dataset. The final output is then generated by combining the predictions from the two views. The model is then evaluated on the"
